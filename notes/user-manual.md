## Your First Steps

### The Welcome Flow

When you first log in, you'll be guided through the onboarding process:

2. **Start Your First Ritual** - Begin tracking your painting time
3. **Explore the Feed** - See what other painters are working on

---

## The Confession

### What is a Confession?

The Confession is how you enter your "pile of shame" into the system. It's a moment of honesty that starts your redemption journey.

### How to Confess

1. Navigate to the **Confess** page (or it will be suggested after registration)
2. Enter the number of unfinished miniatures in your collection
3. Click **"Confess & Begin"**

> **Remember:** There's no judgment here. Every painter has a pile of unfinished projects. This is between you and the Order.

### What Happens Next

After confessing:
- Your confession appears in the community feed
- Other painters can see your declaration (but not the specific miniatures)
- You can update your pile size anytime through your profile

## The Ritual

### What is a Ritual?

A Ritual is a focused painting session. It's not about perfection—it's about showing up and putting in the work.

### Starting a Ritual

1. Click **"Begin Ritual"** from the navigation
2. Click **"Start Ritual"** to begin the timer
3. Paint your miniatures!
4. Click **"End Ritual"** when done

### Logging Your Progress

After ending a ritual, you'll log:

- **Duration** - How long you painted (minimum 1 minute)
- **Minis Progressed** - How many miniatures you worked on
- **Activity Type** - What you did:
  - Priming
  - Basecoating
  - Highlighting
  - Washing
  - Detailing
  - Finishing

### Pro Tips for Rituals

- Rituals must be at least 1 minute (we're not counting quick touches!)
- You can log multiple miniatures in one session
- Choose the activity type that best describes what you spent the most time on

---

## The Feed

### Understanding the Feed

The Feed is where you see all the painting activity from the community. It shows:

- **Confessions** - When someone enters their pile size
- **Rituals** - When someone completes a painting session

### Viewing the Feed

1. Navigate to the **Feed** page
2. Scroll through chronological posts
3. See what other painters are working on

The feed is sorted by most recent activity, so you'll always see the latest updates first.

## Reactions

### How to React

When you see another painter's post, you can show your support with reactions:

- **🙏 Pray** - Show support and encouragement
- **🔥 Purify** - Celebrate impressive effort and dedication  
- **👑 Exalt** - Honor a completed miniature or major milestone

### Adding a Reaction

1. Find a post in the Feed
2. Click the reaction button you want to use
3. The reaction count updates immediately

> **Note:** You can only add one reaction per post. Choose wisely!

### Why Reactions Matter

Reactions are the primary way we show support in the Pile of Fame community. A simple "Pray" can mean a lot to someone who needs encouragement to keep painting.

## Tips for Success

### Building Your Streak

1. **Paint every day** - Even 5 minutes counts!
2. **Log immediately** - Don't wait until the end of the day
3. **Start small** - A 15-minute session is better than no session

### Getting the Most Out of the Community

1. **React to others** - Your support matters
2. **Check the feed daily** - Stay connected to the community
3. **Share your progress** - Every ritual is worth celebrating

### Common Questions

**Q: Can I log a ritual without painting?**
A: No - rituals represent real painting time. The minimum is 1 minute.

**Q: Can I edit a ritual after submitting?**
A: Not currently. If you made a mistake, log a new ritual with the correct information.

**Q: What happens if I miss a day?**
A: Your streak will reset, but don't worry! Every painter has ups and downs. Just start a new ritual when you're ready.

**Q: Can I hide my pile size from others?**
A: Your pile size is only shown in your confession post. It's not displayed on your profile.

## The Philosophy Behind Pile of Fame

Pile of Fame was created with a simple belief: **the effort matters more than the result.**

We don't track:
- Detailed army lists
- Individual miniature data
- Paint colors used
- Complex inventory

We do track:
- Time spent painting
- Sessions completed
- Streaks built
- Community support

### The Core Loop

1. **Confess** - Be honest about where you are
2. **Ritual** - Show up and paint
3. **Share** - Let the community see your effort
4. **Receive** - Get encouragement through reactions
5. **Repeat** - Build momentum through consistency
